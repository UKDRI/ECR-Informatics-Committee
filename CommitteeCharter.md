Last updated by Charlotte Capitanchik Wed, Sep 13, 2023 3:23 PM

### General

The committee will meet roughly every 5 weeks. Our goal is to build a robust network of ECR Informatics researchers across the UK DRI and to provide these researchers with meetings and opportunities relevant to their interests, that will help their research and career development.

### Committee Chair

A new chair will be decided on every quarter. It is the chair's responsibility to organise meetings roughly every 5 weeks and manage the projects of the committee.

### Membership of the committee

Membership of the committee is on a rolling one year basis. If a member doesn't attend two meetings in a row without contacting the committee with a reasonable explanation, they will be removed from the committee.
