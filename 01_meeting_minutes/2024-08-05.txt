## Notes
- Website (Matteus's update):
    Permission issues/token problem. Was able to build locally.
    Short list of bio requirements/proforma for the website to include:
    Post, Name,Centre, Why ECR bioinformatics group:
    MS: Create a tutorial for the website editing please?
    CM: Should we fork GitHub repo? MH: Not necessary Clone it locally make a branch and then push edits eventually but not necessary now.
- behind the p-value
    1st session in Early October: WIP: behind the p-value.
    Behind the p-values and WIP two separate sessions. Trial one of each to judge the interest.
    Fifteen minutes each with 10 minutes questions? Digital poll at the end to create word clouds. General questions on the utility of the WIP and behind the p-values.
    Possible idea for behind the p-values: https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)00578-3?uuid=uuid%3Aa3249738-c635-4202-a36b-689e75bb41a4
Data clinics and bioinformatician collaborations
- Core team
    AZ: Informatics Core team will start in September 2024!
    DOI for DRI: Everything DRI produces will have its own organisational DOI including papers and software. Currently using ChatGPT to scour PubMed.
    KR: Contracts with specific journals with respect to the DOI?

- Hackathon
    No update except that DEMON is keen but are struggling internally with their own renewal. They have funding from ARUK to do a hackathon. Will chase with David Cash.
- Connectome?
    Structure and numbers significantly different this year. Eg Poster numbers reduced substantially.
    CM: We should represent the Bioinformatics Committee for visibility and to raise popularity.
    MH: Is there money for a second symposium? AZ: No indication yet.
    Maybe our best target is ECR day! We need a booth!
    AZ: Restructuring shouldnâ€™t affect the Bioinformatics core.
    Regenerative Art using R codes / Analyse search history etc..
    Contact Emilia

    KR: Created a template folder. Requested everyone to check the content. Will finish by the end of the week.

## Action Items
    Action for MH: Sort out the zoom host/co-host.
