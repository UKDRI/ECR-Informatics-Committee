# Create the ggplot with dodged bars and colourblind-friendly palette
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = question, y = count, fill = experience)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +  # Use viridis colour palette
  labs(x = "Question", y = "Count", title = "Ordered Plot") +

```

Seems like most folk aren't familiar with CI/CD, containers, unit tests and workflow managers (@fig-plot).
Most people are aware off/actively using version control and virtual environments though.
One wonders to what extend they're fully utilising even those though!
