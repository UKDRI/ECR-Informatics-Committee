    "text": "In the labs of Soyon Hong (UKDRI at UCL) and Kenneth Harris (Cortex Lab at UCL) I am studying the role of microglia in Alzheimer’s Disease using spatial transcriptomics. When learning to work with advanced data analysis methods, I realized that we were not making full use of the incredibly rich informatics community at the UKDRI. By creating means for (starting) informaticians to connect - through events or digital platforms - I hope to contribute to making the informatics community a place that both propels cutting-edge computational approaches in dementia research and serves as a springboard to those breaking into the field."

It doesn’t matter if you are a master of the craft or a beginner, we want to form a network that will enrich your ECR experience."

Why did they choose one package over another? How were the data filtered, and why were those filters chosen? Why UMAP and not tSNE, or vice versa?\nThe Informatics ECR committee invite you to a different kind of seminar that aims to focus on the informatics analyses that underlie published work.\nJoin us as Dr. Anna Mallach, Edmond and Lily Safra Research Fellow and UKDRI Emerging Leader at Imperial, discusses the methods and decisions she used when analysing data for her recent paper in Cell Reports (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114216)."

I work mainly on Alzheimer’s disease with a focus on the neurovasculature side of things, typically working with single nuclei seq data.\nI’ve a big interest in reproducibility in science! A lot of science isn’t done to a particularly high standard, so I’m very keen to try and help build community around better practises in the UKDRI (Git repo templates, training, support networks, etc). I’d like to make it easier for folk to adopt better practises and make their science more transparent so we can all learn from each other and beat these unpleasent diseases sooner :)"
