I am a trained molecular biologist and self-taught in informatics data analyses. I joined the committee to bridge the gap between the wet lab scientists and informaticians of the UK DRI. I try to represent my experience from this perspective to ensure the theme is inclusive to all levels of experience."

    "text": "In the labs of Soyon Hong (UKDRI at UCL) and Kenneth Harris (Cortex Lab at UCL) I am studying the role of microglia in Alzheimer’s Disease using spatial transcriptomics. When learning to work with advanced data analysis methods, I realized that we were not making full use of the incredibly rich informatics community at the UKDRI. By creating means for (starting) informaticians to connect - through events or digital platforms - I hope to contribute to making the informatics community a place that both propels cutting-edge computational approaches in dementia research and serves as a springboard to those breaking into the field."
