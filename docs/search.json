    "text": "General\nThe committee will meet at a minimum every 5 weeks. Our goal is to build a robust network of ECR Informatics researchers across the UK DRI and to provide these researchers with meetings and opportunities relevant to their interests, that will help their research and career development.\n\n\nCommittee Chair\nThere will be two co-chairs at any time. These will be decided on every year after Connectome. One co-chair will run from March-March, the other co-chair will be from November-November. If there is more than two nominations a vote will be held. It is the chair’s responsibility to organise meetings roughly every 5 weeks and manage the projects of the committee.\n\n\nSecretary\nSecretary will be rotated between other ECR members (not co-chairs) on a rota basis, so that a different member takes this role every time. Committee notes will be shared on our Github repo, making them available to everyone within the UKDRI Github organisation where ever this is sensible.\n\n\nMembership of the committee\nWe will try to have at least one member from each UK DRI centre doing informatics. Currently if a member decides to step down they should make efforts to find a replacement.\nIf a member doesn’t attend two meetings in a row without contacting the committee with a reasonable explanation, they will be removed from the committee. Members are expected to check the Slack channel (#theme-esc-informatics) and emails from the committee."

Why did they choose one package over another? How were the data filtered, and why were those filters chosen? Why UMAP and not tSNE, or vice versa?\nThe Informatics ECR committee invite you to a different kind of seminar that aims to focus on the informatics analyses that underlie published work.\nJoin us as Dr. Anna Mallach, Edmond and Lily Safra Research Fellow and UKDRI Emerging Leader at Imperial, discusses the methods and decisions she used when analysing data for her recent paper in Cell Reports (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114216)."

I have medical imaging acquisition, analysis and data management experiences in both academic and industrial settings. I worked five years at IXICO Ltd, a medical imaging contract research organisation, where I managed the imaging in clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease and oncology for various pharmaceutical sponsors. I collobarate heavily with the Hawkes Institute (formerly known as Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)) to help translate cutting edge informatics and medical imaging analysis techniques are being implemented into clinical research.\nI am also the primary investigator on Health and Bioscience IDEAS, a UK Research and Innovation funded programme to train researchers on how to use medical imaging data more effectively within their work. We have developed numerous interactive coding workshops helping researchers get involved with medical imaging analysis and data management.\nI have an active role on various national and international committees working on imaging in Alzheimer’s disease, including the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the GENetic Frontotemporal Initiative (GENFI). I am Immediate Past Chair of the ISTAART Neuroimaging PIA, an organization of over 1700 neuroimaging researchers working in dementia."

We’ll be starting with a discoveries session where we showcase some cool tools/packages rapid fire. Then we’ll have a brief presentation around the UK DRI GitHub and we’ll finish with a discussion session.\nWe’re very open to changing this structure if that’s what folk want, so please get in touch with any feedback, we are here for you! 😄\nYou don’t have to be a hardcore informatician, if you’re learning or planning to learn informatics related stuff then you are part of the community and should be there!\nYou can find details, a calendar invite and the zoom link to join on the DRI portal here.\nHope to see many of you there!"
