We're looking to recruit some new members to the committee!

We'd really like to have representation from each centre, so folk from the Cambridge and Kings DRI centres would be especially welcome.
Having said that, we don't' intend to be exclusionary, so if you're keen to be involved you're very welcome regardless :)

We'd also like to try and have folk representing different aspect of informatic work, and we're missing a member working with imaging data, so that'd also be great!
