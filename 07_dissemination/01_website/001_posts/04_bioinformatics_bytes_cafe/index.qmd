The inaugural Bioinformatics Bytes CafÃ© is scheduled for 2025-02-28 at 14:00 via Zoom, please come along!

The idea here is to get informatics folks together, sharing cool ideas and chatting. We'll be starting with a discoveries session where we showcase some cool tools/packages rapid fire. Then we'll have a brief presentation around the UK DRI GitHub and we'll finish with a discussion session.

We're very open to changing this structure if that's what folk want, so please get in touch with any feedback, we are here for you! ðŸ˜„

You donâ€™t have to be a hardcore informatician, if youâ€™re learning or planning to learn informatics related stuff then you are part of the community and should be there!

You can find details, a calendar invite and the zoom link to join on the DRI portal [here](https://portal.ukdri.ac.uk/events/bioinformatic-bytes-cafe).

Hope to see many of you there!
