The second Bioinformatics Bytes CafÃ© is scheduled for 2025-04-28 at 15:00 via Zoom, please come along!

As a reminder, the idea here is to get informatics folks together, sharing cool ideas and chatting. We'll be starting with a discoveries session where we showcase some cool tools/packages rapid fire. 
Then we'll have a brief presentation around the UK DRI GitHub and we'll finish with a discussion session.
The main focus for this session will be cell-cell interaction analysis
We'll be going into breakout rooms to discuss experiences in different domains, so one room for single cell seq, one for proteomics and one for cell imaging.

Can't wait to see if everyone finds CellChat as fiddly as I do!

We're very open to changing this structure if that's what folk want, so please get in touch with any feedback, we are here for you! ðŸ˜„

You donâ€™t have to be a hardcore informatician, if youâ€™re learning or planning to learn informatics related stuff then you are part of the community and should be there!

You can find details, a calendar invite and the zoom link to join on the DRI portal [here](https://portal.ukdri.ac.uk/events/bioinformatic-bytes-cafe-2).

Hope to see many of you there!
