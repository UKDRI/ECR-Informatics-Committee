description: Has super handy function for cleaning data, particularly cleaning column names
---

## Problem Solved
I use it most often immediately after I read in a file to clean the column names. It'll do things like remove special characters and replace spaces with underscores.

## Example Usage
```{r}
# Data with dirty column names
head(iris)

# Easy cleaning!
iris |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  head()
```
