Hi! I am a PhD student on the Translational Neuroscience PhD programme at the University of Edinburgh. In my research, I investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Alzheimer's disease and cerebral small vessel disease affect the brain vasculature. To do so, I use a combination of proteomics (supervised by Blanca Díaz Castro, UKDRI Edinburgh), genomics and computational modelling approaches (supervised by Simon Cox and Sarah Harris, Lothian Birth Cohorts). Although I originally trained as a wet lab biochemist, I now spend more and more time doing data analysis and learning bioinformatics. I joined the committee to encourage other new learners to explore the informatics resources available via UK DRI and to help make informatics more accessible to all.
