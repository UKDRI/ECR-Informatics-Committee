Hello there! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge and UKDRI. I work at the intersection between cellular biology, neurosciences, microscopy and data modelling with a particular interest in explaining complex biological systems from first principles.
