I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Surrey Sleep Research Centre, University of Surrey, and UK DRI Care Research & Technology Centre (CRT) at Imperial College London and University of Surrey, Guildford. I am a biomedical engineer interested in all things "SLEEP"! I joined the committee to represent the data analytics and machine learning side of CRT.
