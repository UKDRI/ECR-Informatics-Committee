Affiliated and member of UKDRI and ECR Informatics committee since creation.

[**Who:**]{.underline} I am a senior research fellow in statistical genetics and have been working in the Hardy lab. 

[**Why?**]{.underline} I joined the ECR committee with the hope of helping to create a support network of informaticians/statisticians with varying degrees of experience for researchers in Genomics, Informatics and Statistics. It doesn't matter if you are a master of the craft or a beginner, we want to form a network that will enrich your ECR experience.
