In the labs of Soyon Hong (UKDRI at UCL) and Kenneth Harris (Cortex Lab at UCL) I am studying the role of microglia in Alzheimer's Disease using spatial transcriptomics. When learning to work with advanced data analysis methods, I realized that we were not making full use of the incredibly rich informatics community at the UKDRI. By creating means for (starting) informaticians to connect - through events or digital platforms - I hope to contribute to making the informatics community a place that both propels cutting-edge computational approaches in dementia research and serves as a springboard to those breaking into the field.
