I'm a post-doc bioinformatician in the Webber lab in the Cardiff UKDRI.
I work mainly on Alzheimer's disease with a focus on the neurovasculature side of things, typically working with single nuclei seq data.

I've a big interest in reproducibility in science!
A lot of science isn't done to a particularly high standard, so I'm very keen to try and help build community around better practises in the DRI (Git repo templates, training, support networks, etc).
I'd like to make it easier for folk to adopt better practises and make their science more transparent so we can all learn from each other and beat these unpleasent diseases sooner :)
