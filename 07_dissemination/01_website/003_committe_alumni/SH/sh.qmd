I am an Alzheimer's Society Fellow in the lab of Blanca Díaz Castro (UKDRI at Edinburgh). My current work primarily uses proteomics to study astrocyte endfeet. I am a trained molecular biologist and self-taught in informatics data analyses. I joined the committee to bridge the gap between the wet lab scientists and informaticians of the UK DRI. I try to represent my experience from this perspective to ensure the theme is inclusive to all levels of experience.
