# Discoveries

- Can be found on the committee site [here](https://ukdri.github.io/ECR-Informatics-Committee/07_dissemination/01_website/004_discoveries/)

- The Git/GitHub resources can be found [here](https://openscapes.org/blog/2022-05-27-github-illustrated-series/)
    - The Turing Way also has a nice written guide on version control [here](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/vcs)
    - The [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a great free resource for using Git with R and RStudio

# Breakout room discussions

- ~10 minutes to discuss in rooms what you want as an informatics community

## Room 1

Take a minute to each introduce yourselves!

Here're some suggested topics, but feel free to deviate if you like!
- **Please add any notes from discussion as well!**

---

- Is there anything specific you'd like to see the ECR informatics committee work on? What can we do to help build the community, support good practice and make being an informatician in the DRI more pleasant?

- A DRI ECR informatics symposium!
    - What would you want to see? Any particular topics/sessions/workshops? Did you attend/like the last one (Jan 2024)?
    >> topic specific break-out rooms; lead by someone 
    >> have a data clinic paired with behind the p-value such that you can actually try the tools/methods
    >> session on what is needed for grants on the informatics side of things 

- Training?
    - The Core team will be planning some training, what would you want to be on offer? What format?

feedback on today: flagging of the tools was useful :) + send a calendar invite instead of emails!!

Code review:
Slack channel -> something quicker?
Teams vs slack?
Kings / UCL -> high content imaging people
Cellpose segmentation models, Napari

ECR informatics symposium :
    * More training? Talks for general audience? Less research talks & round tables.
    * Deep dive (e.g 45 min) in a very common algorithm (e.g. dsec)
    * Small hackaton - e.g. 2hrs fixing something, write docs (based on ADDI demo from last year)
    * DRI Resources (e.g IPA) and where to get help, on the portal.
